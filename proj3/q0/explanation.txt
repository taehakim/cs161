a.) First, open the packet capture file and import the private key in Wireshark.
Then, look through the packets with protocol 'HTTP' that is the response to
the 'GET' request to '/secret.html'. After selecting this packet, at the bottom
of the window, select 'Decrypted SSL data'. The resulting panel will show the
secret.
b.) TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
RSA: Used to encrypt and decrypt the premaster secret in the handshake.
AES 256 CBC: Used to encrypt and decrypt all communication after the
handshake with symmetric encryption.
SHA: Used for message authentication codes.
c.) If the communication had used Diffie-Hellman instead of RSA, then the data
has perfect forward secrecy. Meaning that even if the server's private key were
found, the random exponents generated during the handshake would be lost
forever, meaning that the packets could not be decrypted.
