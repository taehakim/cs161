a.) First, generate a private key and certificate request file for
'email.gov-of-caltopia.info'. Then use 'digipwntar/sign' to create a x509
certificate. Then start 'local_webserver/localwebserver' with the proper
command line arguments pointing to both the private key and certificate. Find
the IP address of eth0 by running 'ifconfig eth0' and enter that IP into the
'pcap_tool.py' file. This packet capture script will intercept all DNS requests
and for those requesting 'email.gov-of-caltopia.info.', it will send a packet
to the requester that it is at the IP address of your local webserver that you
started before. These spoofed DNS response packets should arrive before any
legitimate response from a real DNS server. The Governor will then type in his
credentials and they will be printed out in the terminal where you ran the local
webserver.
b.) DNSSEC can be used to prevent this attack. If the Governor's browser
required DNSSEC, then we could not spoof a DNS record without the private key
of 'gov-of-caltopia.info' or the top level 'info' DNSSEC server. The
implications of this vulnerability on the Internet today are important, but
don't invalidate the use for TLS. Someone will have to have access to all of
your traffic, which isn't easy, it may be easier to simply gain access to your
machine directly.
