a.) First, run 'run' to obtain the private key. This script
iterates over the values between 0 and 8000 and passes each
value to 'generate_rsa_pair'. The rsa pair program has been
edited to take an integer to pass to srand to seed the
random values used for key generation. This works because
the original program was only ever using values in between
0 and 8000 for this anyway. After acquiring the proper
private key, start listening to eth0 in Wireshark and import
the private key. Look for the response to the 'GET' request
to '/chat.html' and the messages will be in that packet.
b.) Line 148 does not do what the comment above it says it
should do. The comment states that it adds the microseconds
to the seconds but it only replaces the value. This reduces
the entropy of the seed from ~32 bits to ~13 bits. If the
seed value did have 32 bits of entropy then this scheme
would be secure.
